# Crab Game Decompiled
Join us on this adventure to decompile, unobfuscate, and remake Crab Game!
We want Crab Game to be updated again, as **Dani moved on onto making Karlson and Crab Game stopped recieving updates**.

# Status
## On hold status
Hey there everyone. I'll just have to say that this project is currently on hold because of the amount of other projects that I have and the amount of effort this will take to be completed.
## When will it be continued?
As I have said, I underestimated the amount of effort this would take to complete. If anyone would be able to help, hit me up (Discord username is ThatCDdev). I have some instructions and would love support on this project! For now, I can't do this alone, so either Patreon (still setting that up) or support. This would also mean making it completly open-sourced, which I don't have a problem with.
